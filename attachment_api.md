## Attachment API â€“ Bugs and Comments

**Auth**: Bearer token required  
**Upload field**: `attachment` (multipart/form-data)  
**Max size**: 10 MB  
**Storage**: Uploaded to S3; responses return time-limited signed URLs  
**Access**: You must have access to the bug/report; comment attachment access is checked via the parent bug

### Draft Attachments (for Markdown Content)

For scenarios where you need to upload attachments before creating a bug (e.g., when using markdown content with images), you can use draft attachments.

#### Upload Draft Attachment
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/v2/attachments/draft`
- **Body**: multipart/form-data, file field `attachment`
- **Allowed types**: Same as bug attachments (see below)
- **Response 201**:
  - `success: true`
  - `data`: `id, image_url, filename, size, type, created_at, is_draft: true`

Example:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://demoapi.whyxpose.com/api/v2/attachments/draft" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
  -F "attachment=@/path/to/screenshot.png"
```

#### Link Draft Attachments to Bug
When creating a bug, include the `attachment_ids` array to link previously uploaded draft attachments:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://demoapi.whyxpose.com/api/v2/reports/123/bugs" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
